## **Briefly About Myself:** 
 I am studying humanities, and Law, but all my life i have wanted to work in a technical discipline.
  

   I decided to learn the field of IT
To begin with, i understood in general what it is and how it works, i must say that it was not easy



I decided for myself that I would like to see the result immediately.
I started to study independent typesetting and maybe there were not enough tips (a mentor), so I quickly threw it all away, later I paid attention to such a language as PHP, studied its base and tried to do something with it by adding a database.
Later, he returned to the FRONT side and studied the elements needed for the front.


I found suitable courses for myself and i believe I hope that my dream of working with a technical discipline will soon become a reality, namely with Frontend Developer
